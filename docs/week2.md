# Week 1 (22/09/2024 - 28/09/2024)

## Introduction

Welcome to the second week of my internship with Chimi. This week was quite an unusual experience for me, as I had to adapt to a more formal industrial environment. It was both funny and enjoyable to play the role of an office-going professional. ![me_this_days](https://i.redd.it/iaoxv23z40za1.jpg){ align=right }

During the week, we added more animations and redesigned the services page to enhance user experience with a more intuitive design. We were also fortunate to have our Director spare some time to impart knowledge on UI design, Docker, hexadecimal values, and the text-based web browser, Lynx.

## Highlights

1. Added animations to the home page, along with a new card addressing the available courses at the iBEST Institute, which redirects users to the services page for more details.
2. Updated the services page with a clickable table displaying all the available courses. Clicking on a course redirects users to its details on the same page.
3. Revised the color scheme and icons to give the institute's website a more formal look.
4. Presented our UI design to the Director, followed by making necessary updates based on his feedback.
5. Initialized a personal backend project for a chat application using the Phoenix Framework. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/C-gyeltshen/chat_backend.git).

## Learning Experience

* Gained a deeper understanding of the importance of color combinations and typography in UI design.
* Learned how human psychology plays a role in the perception of visual elements, especially the impact of drop shadows and border-radius on components.
* Familiarized myself with the text-based web browser Lynx, including installation and basic usage. (Personal)
* Explored the Phoenix Framework for server-side authentication, routing, and serving data to the client in formats like HTML and JSON. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/C-gyeltshen/chat_backend.git) (Personal)

## Industry Insights

By the end of this week, I realized that creating a user-friendly prototype design is crucial in the process of building any project. It acts as a guide for all the subsequent work and ensures that everyone involved is aligned with the overall vision.

## Challenges

* Understanding the right color combinations and finding suitable UI design references.
* Finding good resources to study the Phoenix Framework, particularly for routing and handling POST requests.

## Next Week's Plan

* Start designing the UI for tablet view.
* Complete authentication for the chat application (Personal).
