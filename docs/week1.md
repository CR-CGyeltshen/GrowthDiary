# Week 1 (16/09/2024 - 21/09/2024)

## Introduction

Hi! My name is Chimi Gyeltshen, and I am currently working as a Software Developer at iBEST Institute with the iBEST Technologies team from 16/09/2024 to 28/02/2025.

Under the Director of Technology, I have been asked to assist my friend Yonten, who is developing a prototype for iBEST Institute.

## Highlights

1. Added two new pages: **Contact Us** and **About Us**.

2. Implemented scroll animation on the home page.
3. Read *Introduction to Algorithms* by Thomas H. Cormen.
4. Improved the Figma design and consulted with the Director three times.

## Learning Experience

1. Mastered vertical and horizontal animations in Figma.
2. Learned a new algorithm known as the **Divide and Conquer Algorithm**.
3. Familiarized myself with the open-source library **TanStack Query** (or **React Query**) for efficient data fetching and state management.
4. Understood how to use queries and mutations in a React application. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/C-gyeltshen/chatApp-FrontEnd.git).

## Industry Insights

After starting my internship, I realized that as a software developer, it is essential to be proficient in multiple languages and frameworks. At iBEST, the backend is built with Go, while the frontend utilizes React and Flutter for state management.

## Challenges

- Understanding how frames and components work when creating animations in Figma.
- Finding the right UI design for reference.
- Grasping and implementing queries and mutations in React.

## Next Week's Plan

- Improve the UI components and give a formal look to the prototype.
- Continue reading and deepening my understanding of *Introduction to Algorithms*.
