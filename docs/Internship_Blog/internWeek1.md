# **Week 1 (16/09/2024 - 21/09/2024)**

## 🌟 **Introduction**

Hi! My name is **Chimi Gyeltshen**, and I am currently working as a **Software Developer** at **iBEST Institute** with the **iBEST Technologies** team from **16/09/2024 to 28/02/2025**.

Under the guidance of the **Director of Technology**, I have been tasked with assisting my friend **Yonten**, who is developing a prototype for iBEST Institute.

---

## 🚀 **Highlights**

1. Added two new pages: **Contact Us** and **About Us**.
   
2. Implemented **scroll animations** on the home page.

3. Read *Introduction to Algorithms* by **Thomas H. Cormen**.

4. Improved the **Figma design** and consulted with the Director three times.

---

## 📚 **Learning Experience**

1. **Mastered** vertical and horizontal animations in **Figma**.

2. Learned a new algorithm: the **Divide and Conquer Algorithm**.

3. Familiarized myself with the open-source library **TanStack Query** (formerly known as **React Query**) for **efficient data fetching** and state management.

4. Understood how to use **queries** and **mutations** in a React application. You can view the project here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/C-gyeltshen/chatApp-FrontEnd.git).

## 💡 **Industry Insights**

After starting my internship, I realized that being a **software developer** involves mastering multiple **languages** and **frameworks**. At iBEST, the **backend** is built with **Go**, while the **frontend** utilizes **React** and **Flutter** for state management.

---

## ⚠️ **Challenges**

- Understanding how **frames** and **components** work when creating animations in **Figma**.

- Finding the right **UI design** for reference.

- Grasping and implementing **queries** and **mutations** in React.

---

## 🎯 **Next Week's Plan**

- Improve the **UI components** and give the prototype a formal look.

- Continue reading and deepening my understanding of *Introduction to Algorithms*.
