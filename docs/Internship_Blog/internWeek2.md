# **Week 2 (22/09/2024 - 28/09/2024)**

## üåü **Introduction**

Welcome to the second week of my internship with **Chimi**. This week was quite an unusual experience as I adapted to a more formal industrial environment. It was both funny and enjoyable playing the role of an office-going professional.

Throughout the week, we enhanced the **user experience** by adding more animations and **redesigned** the services page with a more intuitive design. We also had the privilege of receiving insights from our **Director** on **UI design**, **Docker**, hexadecimal values, and the **text-based web browser, Lynx**.

## üöÄ **Highlights**

1. **Added animations** to the homepage, including a new card highlighting available courses at the iBEST Institute, which redirects users to the services page for more information.  

2. **Updated the services page** with a clickable table displaying all available courses. Clicking on a course brings up its details on the same page.

3. Revised the **color scheme** and icons to give the institute's website a more **formal** and professional appearance.

4. Presented our **UI design** to the Director and made the necessary updates based on his **feedback**.

5. **Initialized** a personal backend project for a **chat application** using the **Phoenix Framework**. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/C-gyeltshen/chat_backend.git)
