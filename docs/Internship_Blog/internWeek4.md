# **Week 4 (07/10/2024 - 13/10/2024)**

## üåü **Introduction**

Welcome to the fourth week of my internship with **Chimi**. After designing the **desktop prototype** for the iBEST Institute website, we started implementing the UI design using **React** and **Next.js**. Additionally, I began working on the backend for the **cocoCommercial** website, focusing on the database schema and user authentication. This week offered a well-rounded blend of **frontend** and **backend** development.

## üöÄ **Highlights**

1. **Completed** the desktop prototype design for the iBEST Institute website, incorporating **feedback** from clients and the Director. The design was approved, and we started implementation using **React** and **Next.js**. [GitHub](https://github.com/C-gyeltshen/iBEST_INSTITUTE_WEBSITE.git)
   
2. Created **reusable components** like the navbar and footer using **ShadcnUI**. Completed the **homepage** and **Contact Us** page, and we're exploring the integration of **Mapbox** for the Contact Us section.
   
3. Finished the **schema design** for the cocoCommercial website and prepared **wireframes** for my group members to start working on the prototype.

4. Installed **VM Fusion** for Kali Linux and started learning **cybersecurity** through **TryHackMe**.

## üìö **Learning Experience**

1. **Tailwind CSS Animations:** Learned the importance of caution when adding animations with **Tailwind CSS** as it can affect the site's overall performance.

2. **Reusable Components in React:** Understood the importance of creating reusable components in **React** to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy.

3. **Cybersecurity Basics:** Started learning **cybersecurity** via **TryHackMe**. Focused on offensive learning, discovering tools like **gobuster** and mastering **DIR commands** for web server directory enumeration.

4. **Git Collaboration:** Gained practical experience working as a **Git collaborator**‚Äîpushing, pulling changes, and resolving **merge conflicts**.

5. **Tailwind CSS Customization:** Learned how to add **custom colors**, backgrounds, and fonts to the **Tailwind CSS config file**.

## üí° **Industry Insights**

1. **Effective Teamwork:** Collaboration requires **effective communication** and coordination, especially when working on the same project. Understanding how to use **Git** proficiently is essential.

2. **Branch Management:** Every Git collaborator should create **feature branches** and merge them into the main branch only after thorough testing. I learned the significance of this practice during the week.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges**

1. Grasping how to use **gobuster** and **DIR commands** for directory enumeration on a web server was a challenging task but an essential learning curve.

2. Mapping the **database schema** with the features we want to implement on the **cocoCommercial** website was tricky and required some in-depth analysis.

3. Combining **ShadcnUI components** to create new, more complex components tested my UI design understanding.

4. Understanding **error messages** and mastering **shortcut keys** in **Kali Linux** proved challenging but rewarding.

## üéØ **Next Week's Plan**

1. **Complete** the implementation of the iBEST Institute website using **React** and **Next.js**.

2. Start learning **Android development** and begin work on the **cocoCommercial** website.

3. Configure a **shared database** for the cocoCommercial website.

4. Finish all **TryHackMe** learning modules, especially the ones related to **basic cybersecurity**.
