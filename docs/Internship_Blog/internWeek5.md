# **Week 5 (13/10/2024 - 19/10/2024)**

## üåü **Introduction**

Welcome back, readers! This is my fifth week of the internship, and my friend and I have finally finished coding the website for iBEST Institute. It was a great time to dive into other exciting topics, especially something as fascinating as **Cyber Security**. Alongside that, I'm starting to learn **Android Development** to enhance my personal knowledge in web development, with the help of a new Android developer from Bangladesh who recently joined iBEST.

## üöÄ **Highlights**

1. Completed the coding part for iBEST Institute using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs), [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/select), and the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/C-gyeltshen/iBEST_INSTITUTE_WEBSITE.git).

2. Created a [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/dashboard) account and completed 4 rooms with many interesting tools that ethical hackers use to test and attack hosts.

3. Got access to **Udemy Academy** to start learning Android Development. I aim to be proficient in Android development by the end of the course.

## üìö **Learning Experience**

1. Improved **responsiveness** using **Tailwind CSS**.

2. With the completion of basic **pentesting**, I learned how to think and plan like a hacker rather than just expecting an output after running commands. Before extracting critical credentials from a host, it's essential to:
   - Check if the host is up by pinging the network.
   - Search for all available ports.
   - Identify which ports to target.
   - Use tools like **nmap** for network mapping, **gobuster**, **dirbuster**, and **ffuf** to brute-force and enumerate hidden directories of the target URL.

## üí° **Industry Insights**

1. As learners, we need to take responsibility for our learning and make time for self-study.

2. Before starting a project, it's crucial to:
   - Create a **Product Backlog**: a prioritized list of all functionalities the team needs to implement.
   - Identify a **Sprint Backlog**: select items from the product backlog that the team will work on during a sprint and estimate the time required.

3. **Scrum** is an agile project management framework that helps teams manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges**

1. Understanding error messages while gathering information about the target host.

2. Grasping **nmap** commands and learning about the target host's infrastructure.

## üéØ **Next Week's Plan**

1. **Complete** the iBEST Institute website using **React** and **Next.js**.

2. Continue learning **Android development**.

3. Improve my understanding of and ability to perform basic **pentesting**.
