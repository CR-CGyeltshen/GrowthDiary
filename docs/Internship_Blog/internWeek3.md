# **Week 3 (28/09/2024 - 06/10/2024)**

## üåü **Introduction**

Welcome, everyone! It's the third week of my internship, and it‚Äôs been a productive time here at **iBEST**, working alongside knowledgeable employees. This week, we completed the prototype for the **mobile and tablet views** of the iBEST Institute website, which the clients approved. Additionally, I‚Äôve been working on designing the **schema** for **cocoCommercial**, a website builder I proposed for my **capstone project** in the third semester.

## üöÄ **Highlights**

1. Studied **UI design** and its implementation, focusing on creating **UI components** like cards using concepts from **[Material Design](https://material.io/)**.
   
2. Successfully **redesigned the Courses subpage** under the Services section, applying the **card design** concept I learned.

3. Started using **[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)**, an online platform for learning **cybersecurity**. I installed **VM Fusion** for **Kali Linux** and am excited to dive deeper into this field.

4. Completed the **Maximum Subarray Problem** under the **Divide and Conquer Algorithm**, which is similar to the **[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)** problem on **LeetCode**. It was intriguing to explore multiple approaches for solving and analyzing this problem. _(Personal Achievement)_

## üìö **Learning Experience**

1. Began studying **Object-Oriented Programming** through **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)** on YouTube, with plans to apply it in future **AI projects**.
   
2. Started reading **Docker documentation**, with the intention of using Docker in my **capstone project**.

3. Learned about **[Database Multi-Tenancy](https://medium.com/@harish.somasundar14/database-multi-tenancy-7c8dbe848d50)**, a method for efficiently sharing a single database among multiple merchants ‚Äî specifically **shop owners** in my capstone project.

## üí° **Industry Insights**

1. I realized that **different tools** are suited for different tasks. Initially, I thought **React** and **Next.js** could handle all **frontend development**, but that‚Äôs not always the case.

2. When building new projects, it‚Äôs important to understand three key steps:

   * **Leverage open-source resources** to gain reference and clarity on what you want to implement.
   
   * **List the data** that needs to be stored in data-centric projects and decide **how** to store it.
   
   * After deciding **what** and **how** to store the data, cross-check that the **database schema** supports the features you plan to implement.

   * Create a **prototype** to serve as a reference while building the frontend.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges**

1. Understanding **color combinations** for UI design.

2. Finding the right **resources** for designing the **database schema** for the capstone project.

3. **Listing data to store**, determining which tables to create, and mapping **relationships** between them.

---

## üéØ **Next Week's Plan**

* Complete the **desktop prototype design** by Wednesday.

* Conduct a group meeting for the **capstone project** to cross-check whether the **database schema** aligns with the required features.

* Study **third-party authentication** and attempt to implement **Docker** for the capstone project.

This week was packed with design updates, learning, and backend work, and I‚Äôm excited to tackle more challenges next week! üíªüöÄ
