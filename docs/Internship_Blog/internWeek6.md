# **Week 6 (19/10/2024 - 27/10/2024)**

## 🌟 **Introduction**

Welcome to my blog! In this post, I’ll share my experiences from the **sixth week** of my internship. This week has been the best so far as I had the opportunity to explore **Amazon Cloud Services**, something I’ve always dreamed of learning. Additionally, I started my Udemy course on **Android Jetpack Compose**, which I’m really excited about. All of this was possible thanks to my mentor, **Sonam Sir**, who generously provided an **AWS EC2 instance** for me to learn and explore.

## 🚀 **Highlights**

1. **Deployed a Next.js app** on an **AWS EC2 instance** and managed the instances.
2. Exported **static pages** from Next.js and deployed them on **AWS S3**.
3. Installed **Android Studio** and began learning Android Jetpack Compose on Udemy.
